# MCC-2023-challenge

This repository houses all the python algorithms that sovle the MCC challenge. There are 6 problems and each problem will have around 10 different sets of input data. File handling is neccesary as sometimes
thousands of pieces of data need to be input. 

Key Dates
Update (10 Sep 2023): The MCC 2023 dates have been delayed from 14-15 Oct to 4-5 Nov due to unforeseen circumstances. If you have already paid and cannot participate on the new dates, you may email mcc [at] ioimalaysia [dot] org for a refund. We are sorry for the inconvenience.

5 September 2023: Registration opens.
14 October 2023: Deadline for registration.
4 November 2023 (Saturday) 00:00 (GMT+8): MCC 2023 begins.
5 November 2023 (Sunday) 23:59 (GMT+8): MCC 2023 ends.
What is MCC?
The MCC (Malaysian Computing Challenge) is an annual online competition designed to evaluate participantsâ€™ computational thinking abilities. Knowledge of programming is recommended but not required.

Format
MCC will be held on SimpleCMS (our in-house contest system!). Participants will be required to solve 4-6 problems within a two-day window. Participants may work on the problems throughout the two-day window.

Participants may work on the contest anywhere, including at home. Please review the Honour Code section later on this page.

The problem statements will be available in both English and Bahasa Malaysia.

Each problem consists of a statement describing the problem, and several tasks.
Each task consists of an input that is unique to each participant.
For each task, participants will be required to submit an output (by typing/pasting the output into a text box) that satisfies the statement and input.
Full score for a task will be awarded if the output submitted is correct, zero score will be awarded otherwise. Participants will know whether their submission is correct immediately after it is made.
Each task has a submission limit independent of each other.
Participants will not need to upload code during the contest. As long as they can produce the correct output, they can use any programming language or method (even solve by hand for small inputs).
The more difficult tasks will likely require programming knowledge.
Python is recommended for beginners, and C++ is recommended as it is the only language supported in the later rounds (see the Beyond MCC section).
Participants are encouraged to save any code they have written to be submitted for the exit interview.
